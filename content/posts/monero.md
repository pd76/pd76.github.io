Many people have asked me why I use Monero and care so much about privacy, so here's my answer.

Most traditional banks are not just storing your money; they're harvesting some of the most sensitive data about you. Every transaction you make paints a picture of your life - your habits, your preferences, your politics, and more than you could ever imagine. Banks coordinate with insurance companies and advertising agencies to analyze our transaction data in search of ways to charge us more or manipulate our buying behavior.

The Fourth Amendment protects Americans from unreasonable searches by the government, yet most people roll over and give up when private entities essentially conduct invasive searches of their financial lives. They treat it as part of the cost of doing business in modern America, or they believe it is necessary for fraud prevention.

While proponents argue that financial surveillance can help prevent fraud, this benefit is vastly outweighed by what I call the "assumed consent" model, where agreements from decades ago are used to assume consent into new privacy-invading initiatives{{ sidenote(content="You were okay with this one thing, you'll surely be okay with this other thing, so lets bury it on page 43 in a font so small you need a microscope to read it!") }}. The current banking system actively works to squeeze every bit of value from your personal data, sharing it with insurance companies, tech giants, and advertisers.
